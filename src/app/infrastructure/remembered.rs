//! What a panel last showed, so it can paint that again instead of an empty

//! Only reads of a slow source belong here: a working copy scan, a session
//! transcript, a catalog. Selection, scroll, focus, and dialog state are
//! per-visit by definition and must never be remembered.
//!
//! A remembered value always carries the [`Stamp`] it was read from, and a
//! value that cannot be stamped is never reused. A hit counts as a use, so the
//! entries a panel keeps coming back to are the ones that survive the limit.
